# BankoftheWorld

BankoftheWorld is a conceptual finance app that imagines a future where all countries adopt a single, unified global currency. Designed as both a simulation and a fintech prototype, the app allows users to manage, transfer, and calculate transactions using a digital-first currency modeled after crypto and sci-fi credits.

Key features include:

Secure digital wallet & global transfers

Real-time currency calculator with purchasing power simulation

Budgeting, savings goals, and investment tools

Centralized global currency management system

This project explores themes of global cooperation, economic unification, and futuristic banking through sleek UI, currency logic, and interactive features.

“One World. One Currency.”
